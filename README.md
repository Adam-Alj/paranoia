# Project Description

Paranoia aims to be a one-stop-shop for network monitoring in linux. With sane defaults and an attractive UX, Paranoia is aimed towards those who want to *see* all of their network connections without having to have a deep understanding of networking in general.

In other words, this aims to answer the following question in an immediate and understandable manner: "What are all of the network connections occurring on my system right now, and why?".
